Programmatic Problems:
1.In Python 3, Different languages behave differently when encoded in bytes for e.g

English : 'Give your application an accessibility workout\n'
Hindi : 'अपने अनुप्रयोग को पहुंचनीयता व्यायाम का लाभ दें\n'

English Bytes : b'Give your application an accessibility workout\n'
Hindi Bytes : b'\xe0\x\xa5..xa4\x82\n'
Hence, Training is impossible while sticking to general convention of using bytes for languages.
Thus, we recoded every byte processing while making sure training doesn't get affected.

2.We had to apply small hack in "tensorflow/contrib/legacy_seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py"
 because deepcopy was failing in latest tensorflow vesion(>1.0).
